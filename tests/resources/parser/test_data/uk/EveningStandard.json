            "Chelsea have delivered a message of intent and roared their season was not dead after beating Tottenham.",
            "Much has been made about whether Mauricio Pochettino will continue as manager next season, but against Spurs, the club where he made his name, Chelsea team put in a performance packed with both character and quality.",
            "This wasn’t the battle of Stamford Bridge eight years ago, but it was one of Chelsea's most impressive wins of the season as they dominated while handling a staggering 14-man injury list.",
            "Yet, the Blues were superior to Ange Postecoglou’s Champions League chasers and deserved to take home three points after goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Nicolas Jackson.",
            "Gallagher’s day in the spotlight",
            "The Shed End held up a banner to send a simple message to Chelsea’s sporting directors, Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart: do not sell our homegrown star.",
            "The crowd-surfing banner actually read: “Chelsea since birth”.",
            "But the message was clear ahead of kick-off all while Spurs are tipped with making a summer move for Gallagher and Chelsea may need to balance the books by selling academy players.",
            "On the pitch, Gallagher was exceptional. He dominated the midfield battle, outshining Moises Caicedo, as the pairing dominated Pape Matar Sarr and Yves Bissouma.",
            "His curling free-kick was headed in by fellow academy graduate Trevoh Chalobah, who could also be sold.",
            "Chalobah also flies the academy flag",
            "Chalobah was the most decisive player at either end of the pitch, scoring a stunning header in the 24th minute.",
            "He then made a goal-saving block from a Sarr shot later in the first half as Spurs took control.",
            "It’s a real shame that football accounting and the concept of ‘pure profit’ might mean he leaves Chelsea, as he is so committed to the cause.",
            "Alfie Gilchrist also dealt very well with Son Heung-min and Josh Acheamong, who turns 18 in three days, came on for his Chelsea debut.",
            "It was a proud day for the academy at Cobham.",
            "Chelsea’s propelled into Euro race",
            "This match was always going to be key, the rescheduled game from February, which became Chelsea’s game in hand over Newcastle and Manchester United.",
            "Now Chelsea know exactly what they need to do. They have four games left to claw back a three-point gap between Erik Ten Hag’s sixth-place team.",
            "Newcastle, who are seventh, are two points above Chelsea but with a vastly superior goal difference.",
            "The challenge feels achievable but the Blues this well when facing West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth to reach the Europa League or Conference League."
